x Looks like the heart age calculation needs adjustment

x Move Load defaults from file to startup rather than have it happen in Profile registration

Add in provisional Drug interventions

Profile would need:
	a 'current prescription' section	
		- to fill in drugs in use at the time measurements are taken

Intervention would need:
	a 'future prescription' section
		- to fill in drugs to be used
		
Both would be popup panels.
	The current prescription affects the default state for the future prescription, allowing deltas to be calculated
 	When the future prescription panel is dismissed, intervention panel acquires a 3-state menu:
 		'Under new prescription' which applies the deltas.
 		'Under old prescription' which does not apply the deltas.
 		'Untreated' which applies the reciprocal of the old prescription.
